# Kotlin with Compose Multiplatform

Explore the power of Compose Multiplatform and Kotlin Multiplatform by building a simple cross-platform app in Kotlin. Creating one UI for both operating systems.
This project demonstrates sharing everything - from the networking layer to business logic and UI, resulting in an app that can load and display bird pictures from an API on both Android and iOS.

## Key Features

- **Jetpack Compose**: For building native UIs in a declarative way.

- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Write shared code in Kotlin for multiple platforms.

- **Ktor**: Asynchronous HTTP client for making API requests.

- **Kemel**: Image loading and manipulation library for Kotlin.

- **Viewmodel**: ViewModel is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
